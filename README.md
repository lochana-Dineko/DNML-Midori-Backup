DNML short for Digital Novel Markup Language is most likely the first widely adopted Visual Novel Engine. Used even before the advent of Nscripter.

It is surprising powerful. however unlike Ncripter which has a open source reimplementation in the form of Onscripter and its derivatives (Onscripter-en, Onscripter-ru, Ponscripter and so on) DNML has zero open source reimplementations.

DNML Midori was created by a group to supplant the original DNML interprter and it is successful for the most part.
There are a huge number of DNML Books available in the Japanese web, my hope is we get a open source implementation for DNML in the future, lest these historical novels go forgotten.
